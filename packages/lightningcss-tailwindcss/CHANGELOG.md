## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 🚀 **Raise the minimum supported Node.js versions to `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`** [`92b869f`](https://github.com/sonofmagic/dev-configs/commit/92b869fb95ad99a1c7f5f970c675cfa79b8b9a31) by @sonofmagic
  - across all published packages so the supported runtime range matches the
  - default `require(esm)` behavior.
  - Also fix `@icebreakers/eslint-config` so ESLint config loading works on
  - Node.js `20.19.0` by polyfilling `Object.groupBy` when the runtime does not
  - provide it yet. This unblocks `pnpm lint` and test execution for the Node 20
  - CI job.

### Patch Changes

- 🐛 **Add Tailwind CSS analysis utility packages for PostCSS AST and Lightning CSS AST.** [`3847047`](https://github.com/sonofmagic/dev-configs/commit/38470476b5ceb034bd6661f653a8f9a889f660ea) by @sonofmagic
  - Update `stylelint-plugin-tailwindcss` to reuse the PostCSS-based selector collection helpers.

- 🐛 **Migrate all packages under `packages/` to build with `tsdown`.** [`45c73ca`](https://github.com/sonofmagic/dev-configs/commit/45c73ca9f70ba813052c9970b54e08d853e638ce) by @sonofmagic
  - This removes the remaining `tsup` and `unbuild` package-level build configs,
  - switches package scripts to `tsdown`, and keeps the package outputs aligned with
  - the existing published entry points.
