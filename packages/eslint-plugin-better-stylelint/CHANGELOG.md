## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ✨ **Add a new `eslint-plugin-better-stylelint` package that bridges Stylelint** [`1568782`](https://github.com/sonofmagic/dev-configs/commit/15687824f2f0d8004da1d6d035dc96e370c639c1) by @sonofmagic
  diagnostics into ESLint.

  The new package provides:
  - `stylelint/css` processor for CSS-like files
  - `stylelint/scss` processor for SCSS-like files
  - `stylelint/stylelint` rule for Vue SFC files

  The bridge now runs Stylelint through a bundled `synckit` worker instead of
  shelling out to the Stylelint CLI, while still preferring the consuming
  project's own `stylelint` installation when present.

  For Vue SFCs, the rule lints each `<style>` block separately, preserves
  block-specific context such as `scoped`, `module`, and `lang`, and maps the
  reported locations back to the original `.vue` file.

  Also add a `stylelint` option to `@icebreakers/eslint-config` so consumers can
  opt into the bridge directly from the preset.
